# 🤗 Education Toolkit

<aside>

👋 **Welcome!**

We’ve assembled a toolkit that anyone can use to easily prepare workshops, events, homework or classes. The content is self-contained so that it can be easily incorporated in other material. This content is **free** and uses well-known Open Source technologies (`transformers`, `gradio`, etc).

Apart from tutorials, we also share other resources to go further into ML or that can assist in designing content.

## **Other resources to learn your way!**

### **The 🤗 NLP Course**

We provide a course (free and without ads) that teaches you about natural language processing (NLP) using libraries from the **[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/)** ecosystem.

👉 [click here to access the 🤗 Course](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1/1)

<aside>
💡 This course:

- Requires good knowledge of Python
- Is better taken after an introductory deep learning course, such as **[fast.ai’s](https://www.fast.ai/)** **[Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/)** or one of the programs developed by **[DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/)**
- Does not expect prior **[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)** or **[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)** knowledge, though some familiarity with either of those will help
</aside>

### **The 🤗 Gradio Course**

We provide a course (free and without ads) that teaches you how to build interactive demos for your machine learning models using libraries from the **[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/)** ecosystem.

👉 [click here to access the 🤗 Course](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter9/1)

<aside>
💡 This course:

- Its ultimate goal is to allow ML developers to easily present their work to a wide audience including non-technical teams or customers, researchers to more easily reproduce machine learning models and behavior, end users to more easily identify and debug failure points of models, and more!
</aside>

### **The 🤗 RL Course**

We provide a course (free and without ads) that teaches you about Deep Reinforcement Learning using libraries from the **[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/)** ecosystem.
