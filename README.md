# 🤗 Education Toolkit

<aside>

👋 **Welcome!**

We’ve assembled a toolkit that anyone can use to easily prepare workshops, events, homework or classes. The content is self-contained so that it can be easily incorporated in other material. This content is **free** and uses well-known Open Source technologies (`transformers`, `gradio`, etc).
  
On June 6 we're organizing a dedicated, free workshop on how to teach these resources in your community. Do not hesitate to [register](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/how-to-teach-open-source-machine-learning-tools-tickets-310980931337).

Apart from tutorials, we also share other resources to go further into ML or that can assist in designing content.

### 3️⃣ Getting Started with Transformers

> In this tutorial, you get to:
>
> - Transformer neural networks can be used to tackle a wide range of tasks in natural language processing and beyond.
> - Transfer learning allows one to adapt Transformers to specific tasks.
> - The `pipeline()` function from the `transformers` library can be used to run inference with models from the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/models).
>
> This tutorial is based on the first of our O'Reilly book *[Natural Language Processing with Transformers](https://transformersbook.com/)* - check it out if you want to dive deeper into the topic!

## **Other resources to learn your way!**

### **The 🤗 Course**

We provide a course (free and without ads) that teaches you about natural language processing (NLP) using libraries from the **[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/)** ecosystem.

👉 [click here to access the 🤗 Course](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1/1)

<aside>
💡 This course:

- Requires good knowledge of Python
- Is better taken after an introductory deep learning course, such as **[fast.ai’s](https://www.fast.ai/)** **[Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/)** or one of the programs developed by **[DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/)**
- Does not expect prior **[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)** or **[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)** knowledge, though some familiarity with either of those will help
</aside>

### **The 🤗 Book**

<img alt="book-cover" height=200 src="images/book_cover.jpg" id="book-cover"/>

Released February 2022

From experts at Hugging Face, learn all about Transformers and their applications to a wide range of NLP tasks.

<aside>
💡 This book:

- Is written for data scientists and machine learning engineers who may have heard about the recent breakthroughs involving transformers, but are lacking an in-depth guide to help them adapt these models to their own use cases.
- Assumes you have some practical experience with training models on GPUs.
- Does not expect prior **[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)** or **[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)** knowledge, though some familiarity with either of those will help
